Why do so many people call the programs folder "src" ?

'src' has inertia carried over from Unix. Unix systems have kept the source is /usr/src since since at least the late 70s. 
Originally, way, way back in the day, there was good reason to be so terse. The first UNIX machines had literal teletypes for terminals; 
printers with moving parts. Every extra character meant wear and tear, paper, ink, and especially, time.
